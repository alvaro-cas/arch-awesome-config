# SKEY

## Introduction
Recently I have been using KeepassXC, but sometimes I need to use the passwords in my phone and it is really hard to copy 128 characters, so I created this simple script to avoid passing your .kdbx file to your phone but have the power to send your keys in seconds.

## Prerequisites
#### Developer Options
- [Developer Options](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options) enabled and --> USB debugging (I recommend turning this off after usage)

***
## Usage
Copy the desired password normally using KeepassXC or any other password manager. Then use this command to send it to your phone!
```bash
skey
```
